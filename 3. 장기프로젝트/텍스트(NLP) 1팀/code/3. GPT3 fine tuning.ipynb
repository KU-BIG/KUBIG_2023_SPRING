            "to me, childhood has always meant velvet room, floamas iceballs, cute things and frightening ones, but which memories can i recall with greatest clarity, i wish to talk to you today about childhood as a whole, ideas and feelings, even sometimes running away.now let s start with a question every child has asked themselves only execution. to the executioner it s a very stressful period that may last as long as few seconds. while you will be scared and feel a lot of pain, you will have the most butterflies in your body, which is the highest state of human happiness. and while the execution is happening, you will continue laughing and screaming with joy, not just because you re happy, even because you re aware that you re going to die. no, no worry children. for you, it s just playtime, oh yes, you don t know what is waiting for you at that moment. we can t recreate these real moments, but in the suicidals of this opera will be an iconic memory due to its intensity, a constant point of reference that can be used for defining the whole of your childhood.but don t worry about actually dying. what is still useful to bring up and remember it s much more important than to leave the portrait of a trying childhood behind. this is how a teenager, from what i ve heard, thought about his life left, raised in the s a further problem will not give me a heart and means. instead, jean raspail wrote that reasons to live, while leaving us with beautiful books, songs and paintings, allows us to identify the moments that have meant so much to us, moments that stood out as singular in an inexhaustible childhood and have remained memorable in our minds, even turning into the images that have caused their proliferation so many times in the art of film, which is based on childhood memories.that is why, during those seven consecutive years, jean raspail knows that the way towards death is often very enlightening. not because we learn the trajectory, but because seeing all that pain causes us to learn from it and to try and prevent our own childhood from ever being similar to it. only then we ll never become like our past and be able to understand the heroes and legends of childhood better.so where should we focus our gaze there, of course, to the future, to the path ahead, but also to the past. if, in the present, keeping hold of all the things that you can take with you and trying to make all of them come true, it s crucial to be conscious of all that you have devised, it s much more important, in the phrase of jean raspail, to be worthy of the value of the things already realized, to be sure of the importance of things long accomplished. and why i think so because, if childhood memories are yet so unexplored, if the moments from our past remain so elusive, because everything that we\n"
